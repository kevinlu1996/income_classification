# Overview

The task is to predict if a person's income is in excess of `$50,000` given certain profile information, and more specifically to generate predicted probabilities of income being above `$50,000` for each row in the test set.

# EDA

- Model 1: scaled all classification variables, and select all variables with correlation higher +/- 0.15 into the classification model
- Model 2: dummified all classification variables, and select all variables with correlation higher +/- 0.15 into the classification model

# Model

- Adaboost
- Gradient Boost
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Gaussian
- Knn
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVC
- Voting Classifier


# Conclusion

The classification model on test dataset recieves 96% accuracy
